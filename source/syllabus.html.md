## Capstone Project

During the last three weeks of the course, you will be working on your capstone
project, putting all you've learned into practice. You will be working with a
group of 2-4 people on your project.

At the end of week 9, you'll present your idea for a final project and
get feedback, helping you scope the project. During weeks 10, 11, and 12, you'll
work primarily on this project. We will have lecture time, but it will be
tailored to what you need to know for your project and may be optional. We will
let you know what days lecture is optional.

This project must use Ruby on Rails to build a web application of significant
size, backed by a database and using some of the libraries we covered during
class.

A front-end development course is happening at the same time as our class. If
anyone wants to combine efforts with members of that class, that is a fantastic
idea, but expectations for your project will be higher.

## Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. Your MacBook should have a
minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of hard drive space. Those are minimum specs,
and I recommend getting 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB hard drive, but thatâ€™s your
choice to make. Any of the current
[MacBook Air models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html) or
[MacBook Pro models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/) will work.
I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro and really dig it.

There is no commercial software required for the class, but you may want to
purchase some. We are going to use a free text editor in class --
[Atom](http://atom.io) -- but [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is
great, as is [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/). (I am working on a
classroom license for RubyMine, so if you decide to try it out, use the 30-day
trial: do not purchase it yet.)

## Policies

### Absence policy

You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your job placement guarantee is
forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast.

### Late homework policy

Your homework is due by 6 AM on the day it is due. After that, it is late. Like
the absence policy, you can turn in homework late 4 times, although I do not
recommend it.

I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late.
Solid attempts are not considered late.

### Honor code

You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources available to
you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is
prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger
project.

Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting job
placement.

## Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of
a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules
apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us, the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class,
HipChat, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your
teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus director.

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**

* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your
colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
decisions.

* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard
community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
people outside the Iron Yard community.

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. Do not insult
or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class.
This includes, but is not limited to:

    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    * Unwelcome sexual attention.
    * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    * <p>Repeated harassment of others.
      In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p>

* **When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social
and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is
important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its
varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have
different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help
resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
