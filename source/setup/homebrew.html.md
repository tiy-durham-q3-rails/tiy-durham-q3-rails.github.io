# Homebrew setup

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a _package manager_ for OS X. A "package manager"
is a piece of software that installs, updates, and uninstalls other software.
In our class, we will use many pieces of software that are run from the terminal
instead of through a graphical interface. Those pieces of software will be
managed by Homebrew.

To install Homebrew:

1. Open up Terminal.
2. Paste the following command into Terminal: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`
3. Follow the instructions on-screen.
4. When finished, run `brew doctor`.
