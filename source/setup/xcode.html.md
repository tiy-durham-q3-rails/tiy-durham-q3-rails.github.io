# XCode setup

The important thing is that we install the XCode Command-Line Tools. Go to the
[Apple Developer Downloads site](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/). You
will have to register for an Apple developer account if you do not already have
one. Once you are logged in and on this page, look for "Command Line Tools (OS X
Mavericks) for XCode." Click that to expand it and then download the .dmg file
you see there.

your instructor might provide this file to you.</div>

Once you have the .dmg file, double-click it to open it and then run the
"Command Line Tools" .pkg file within it. Follow all the prompts until complete.
