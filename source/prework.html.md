# Recommended work before class

I ask that you complete each of these exercises before the first day of class.
They will ensure you're a step ahead and we can get to the good stuff quickly.
It should take you three hours or so total to work through the mandatory ones.

* Complete the first four levels of [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org).
* Complete the [Try Git walkthrough](https://try.github.io).
* Read [this Treehouse blog post about command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics).
When reading the article, go through all the exercises in the article.
* **BONUS:** Work through [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
This is a longer undertaking than the rest of the exercises and you could spend
eight hours working on this. The author has a really brash and possibly abrasive
tone. The material is good, however. Again, this is totally optional.
